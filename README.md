# Studio Ghibli Films App

The Studio Ghibli Films is a small App written in Javascript to show the use of the [oficial Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) using XMLHttpRequest.

## Installation

Just clone or download the repository from [here]https://github.com/ajsevillano/Ghibli-Studio-WebApp.


## Usage

The film's poster are not included in the app. To be seen in the app you will have to download them to the img/ folder with the name given by the api (movie.title).
Example: for the film "Spirited Away" you will need to download the movie art poster and save in the folder img under the name "Spirited Away.jpg" (Sorry, so far the app only works with JPGS).
